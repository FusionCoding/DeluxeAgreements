      # Sets the maximum size of the MySQL connection pool.
      # - Basically this value will determine the maximum number of actual
      #   connections to the database backend.
      # - More information about determining the size of connection pools can be found here:
      #   https://github.com/brettwooldridge/HikariCP/wiki/About-Pool-Sizing
      maximum-pool-size: 10

      # Sets the minimum number of idle connections that the pool will try to maintain.
      # - For maximum performance and responsiveness to spike demands, it is recommended to not set
      #   this value and instead allow the pool to act as a fixed size connection pool.
      #   (set this value to the same as 'maximum-pool-size')
      minimum-idle: 10

      # This setting controls the maximum lifetime of a connection in the pool in milliseconds.
      # - The value should be at least 30 seconds less than any database or infrastructure imposed
      #   connection time limit.
      maximum-lifetime: 1800000 # 30 minutes

      # This setting controls the maximum number of milliseconds that the plugin will wait for a
      # connection from the pool, before timing out.
      connection-timeout: 5000 # 5 seconds
